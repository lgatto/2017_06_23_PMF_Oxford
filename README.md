I would be delighted to present my work. However, I see I have a
previous commitment on the 22nd, but I'm availabel on the 23rd. Would
that work out for you?

I could talk about

- Computational spatial proteomics, and could focus on the biology of
  protein localisation and available tools, or a more
  computational/algorithmic talk.

- I could give a more general talk about open source R/Bioconductor
  tools for mass spectrometry and proteomics.

- I could also prepare a generic presentation about data processing,
  and/or present more specifically on a processing topic of interest
  such as on missing values or visualisation.
 
- Anything you would be interested in, that would fit the forum?

Thank you for you positive reply! I had planned the computational
session for the 22nd, but don't worry, 23rd will work as well. The PMF
is very methods centered, so we usually encourage to show a bit less
biology and also especially to highlight problems, issues and ideally
solutions, that proteomics people may have in the day to day. Also it
should be accessible across the audience, so algorithms may be a bit
specific, but data visualization i.e. using Bioconductor certainly is
of general interest.
