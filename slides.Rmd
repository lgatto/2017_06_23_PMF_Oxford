# Data analysis

## What is data analysis

> Data analysis is the process by which data becomes understanding,
> knowledge and insight. Hadley Wickham

The ability to prepare and **explore** data, identify **patterns**
(good and pathological ones) and convincingly demonstrate that the
patterns are **genuine** (rather than random).

It's not analysing data, it's *investigating* data - requires flexibility.

## And also

* Reproducibility/replicability
* Automation
* Tracking, re-use, share, communicable


`Programming`,  but:

* Learning curve (although, I would argue that the
  reflecting/investigating/analysing the data is the real challenge)


## To analyse data, you need

* ~~Be a programmer~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~

## To analyse data, you need

* ~~Be a programmer~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~
* Knowledge about the domain
* Know about your data
* Be able to manipulate/visualise it
* How good do we need to be?

* ~~Programming skills~~
* ~~Be a statistician/machine learner~~
* Knowledge about the domain
* Know about your data
* Be able to manipulate/visualise it
* How good do we need to be? **Good enough**

## Visualisation

To understand and communication data:

> Graphics reveal data.

  
> Visualization can surprise you, but it doesn’t scale well. Modeling
> scales well, but it can’t surprise you. Hadley Wickham

# Proteomics

## Quantitative proteomics data analysis

* What data do we have? 
* What analyses can we apply?
* Track/check the data throughout the analysis.

It is not for the tool/software to tell me what plotting/analysis to
perform, it is **for me**, to apply the most appropriate analysis or
visualisation.

# Software: R/Bioconductor

## 

Data analysis tools should enables you to **manipulate** your data,
give some guarantees about the **integrity** of the data, support
effective **extract/subset** components of the data, **visualise**
them, enable **transformation** of the data, give access to
infrastucture for **statistical analysis**, and enable **annotation**
of the data.


## Bioconductor

[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) provides tools for the
analysis and comprehension of high-throughput biology data.

- ~ [1400 packages](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software)
- 62 for [mass spectrometry](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___MassSpectrometry)
- 92 for [proteomics](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Proteomics)

**Collaborative project**: open source and open development.

# Conclusions

## [Some brief advice on data analysis](https://lgatto.github.io/brief-data-analysis-advice/)

- Plan ahead
- Factor in analysis time
- Analyse early, analyse often
- Divide and conquer
- Ask for help
- Be pragmatic
